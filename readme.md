# Messenger Explorer

**Messenger Explorer** is a Facebook backup messages explorer, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) under [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles.

This project is based off of the [react-ts-atomic-storybook](https://github.com/james-yang-dev/react-ts-atomic-storybook/) template.

This repository is pretty bare-bones right now, but more content will be added as development continues.
